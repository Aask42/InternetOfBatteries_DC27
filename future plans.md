# This is a list of future plans and ideas for ANOTHER YEAR

## LED Scripting
- Allow for knowing loop count inside of script
- Math operations in script
- for/do loop functionality
- Ability to set a flash rate of a LED
- Allow variables to select LED

## Messages
- Sync connected information between messages and Mesh as they are not tied together (mesh stores a list and messages stores a separate list)
- Maybe have internal message structure inherit from Mesh() allowing the callback setup to be avoided, can just be functions in the mesh that are overridden
- Graffiti limited to 255 entries total at the moment
